### Content ###

    1. Introduction
        - Recap of previous required knowledge    
    2. The GPU
        - Understanding the basics of how a GPU works, and what can it do.
    3. The Framework
        - A walkthrough over the C++/OpenGL codebase used along the course.
    4. Illumination
        - Basic of Phong equation, types of light (point, spot, directional) and attenuation.
    5. Shadows
        - Shadow techniques, how to generate shadowmaps, optimizations.
    6. First Assignment
        - In the first assigment you must add illumination and shadows to the framework.
    7. Render Pipelines
        - Optimizing the rendering pipeline for more complex environments. Programming a deferred rendering pipeline.
    8. Physicaly Based Materials
        - Understanding the PBR Model, coding the equation and how to improve materials.
    9. HDR and Linear Space
        - High-dynamic range images for better quality and using Linear Color Space to improve fidelity.
    10. Ambient Occlusion
        - Basic implementation of Amblient Occlusion to give better depth to scenes.
    11. Second Assignment
        - Here we will optimize our render pipeline with Deferred Rendering and improve the visual quality with PBR and SSAO.
    12. Irradiance
        - Approaches for bounced light.
    13. Reflections
        - Adding reflections to the scene, from precomputed to realtime.
    14. Volumetric Rendering
        - How to render volumetric elements like fog.
    15. Decals
        - Improving the scene with decals to give detail to surfaces.
    16. Post-processing
        - Understanding a post-processing stack to enhance the visual quality.
    17. Beyond the course
        - Final recap and some guides of how to move forward after this course.
    18. Final Assignment
        - Here we will add Reflections, Irradiance, Volumetric lights and PostFX.     
    19. WebGPU
        - Presentation about WebGPU.
