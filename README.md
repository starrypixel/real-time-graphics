# real-time-graphics
Audit the real-time graphics course taught at UPF .

Content
  Introduction
  - Recap of previous required knowledge
  The GPU
  - Understanding the basics of how a GPU works, and what can it do.
  The Framework
  - A walkthrough over the C++/OpenGL codebase used along the course.
  Illumination
  - Basic of Phong equation, types of light (point, spot, directional) and attenuation.
  Shadows
  - Shadow techniques, how to generate shadowmaps, optimizations.
  First Assignment
  - In the first assigment you must add illumination and shadows to the framework.
  Render Pipelines
  - Optimizing the rendering pipeline for more complex environments. Programming a deferred rendering pipeline.
  Physicaly Based Materials
  - Understanding the PBR Model, coding the equation and how to improve materials.
  HDR and Linear Space
  - High-dynamic range images for better quality and using Linear Color Space to improve fidelity.
  Ambient Occlusion
  - Basic implementation of Amblient Occlusion to give better depth to scenes.
  Second Assignment
  - Here we will optimize our render pipeline with Deferred Rendering and improve the visual quality with PBR and SSAO.
  Irradiance
  - Approaches for bounced light.
  Reflections
  - Adding reflections to the scene, from precomputed to realtime.
  Volumetric Rendering
  - How to render volumetric elements like fog.
  Decals
  - Improving the scene with decals to give detail to surfaces.
  Post-processing
  - Understanding a post-processing stack to enhance the visual quality.
  Beyond the course
  - Final recap and some guides of how to move forward after this course.
  Final Assignment
  - Here we will add Reflections, Irradiance, Volumetric lights and PostFX.
  WebGPU
  - Presentation about WebGPU.
